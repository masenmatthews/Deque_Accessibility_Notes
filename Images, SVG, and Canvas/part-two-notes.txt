Image alt text
  Good alt text is:
    1. Discernible (screen readers can access the alternative text)
    2. Meaningful (the alternative text accurately describes the image's purpose or author's intent in using the image).
    3. Concise (the alternative text does not exceed about 250 characters, and preferably is much shorter than that)

    If an image is decorative or redundant, it can be hidden with alt="" (but this only works with HTML)

  Standard for adding alternative text to images is with the "alt" tag, but it can be done with a number of other attributes as well:
    -aria-labeledby
    -aira-label
    -title

  Informative images
    -Images that convey content MUST have programmatically-discernible alternative text.
      i.e. <img src="sewing_machine_singer.jpg" width="686" height="518" alt="A Singer model antique sewing machine">
    -The alternative text for informative images MUST be meaningful (accurately conveying the purpose of the image, and the author's intent in a way that is useful to those who cannot see the image).
      -Consider:
        1. Why is this non-text content here?
        2. What information is it presenting?
        3. What purpose does it fulfill?
        4. If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same information or function?
    -Alternative text SHOULD NOT include words that identify the element as a graphic or image.
        -i.e. THIS IS BAD: alt="A photo of a Singer model antique sewing machine">
        -DON'T INCLUDE THE WORDS PHOTO, GRAPHIC, OR IMAGE
    -The length of the alternative text for informative images SHOULD be concise (no more than about 250 characters).
        -"Think of alt tags like tweets"

  Decorative or redundant images
    -Images that do not convey content, are decorative, or are redundant to content that is already conveyed in text MUST be given null alternative text (alt=""), ARIA role="presentation", or implemented as CSS backgrounds.

  Actionable Images (Links, Buttons, Controls)
    -Everything that applies to "informative images" applies here
    -Similarly, don't include the words "link, graphic, or image" in the alt tag

  Form Inputs type="image"
    -Form inputs with type="image" MUST have alternative text.
      -i.e: <input type="image" name="submit" src="submit-button.png" alt="Submit">
    -Accurate and concise
    -No more than 250 characters

  Animated images
    -A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any prerecorded video-only content that begins playing automatically and which lasts 5 seconds or more
    -Animated images MUST NOT flash or flicker at 3 or more times per second.

  Complex images
    -Complex images MUST be briefly described using alt text AND MUST have a more complete long description.
      -Several ways of adding a longer description alongside a <250 character alt tag:
        1. Provide the long description in the context of the HTML document itself.
        2. Provide a button that expands a collapsed region that contains the long description.
        3. Provide a button to open a dialog that contains the long description.
        4. Provide a link to a long description on another page via a normal link text.
        5. Provide a link to a long description on another page via the longdesc attribute

    Good Example: Example 1: provide context in HTML itself
      i.e.
      <img class="border" src="bar-chart.png" width="546" height="330"
      alt="Bar chart with percentages. Extended description below chart."
      aria-describedby="description-extended">

      <div id="description-extended">
        <p>Full long description goes here.</p>
      </div>

    -The long description (or a link or button to access the long description) SHOULD be visible to sighted users.

    -Images of text
      -An image MUST NOT include informative text if an equivalent visual presentation of the text can be rendered using real text.
        -Good example: logo in text
        <img src="deque_logo.png" width="165" height="59" alt="Deque">
      -Images MUST NOT include informative text, unless the text is essential (such as a logo), or the font, size, color, and background are customizable.

    -CSS background images
      -Purely decorative or redundant CSS images SHOULD NOT have a text alternative in the HTML content.
        -Wasting space is dumb and bad
      -The alternative text for informative or actionable CSS images MUST be available as programmatically-discernible text in the HTML content.
        -Good Example: Actionable (linked) background image with alternative text via aria-label
          -i.e. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dequesystems" class="fb" aria-label="Deque's Facebook page"></a>
      -The alternative text (in the HTML content) for informative or actionable CSS images MUST adequately and accurately describe the purpose of the image.
